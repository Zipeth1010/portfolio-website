          I started my coding journey as of December 2022, and in that time I
          have done a lot of self learning and attended a software engineering
          bootcamp. The result of my studies has made me proficient in
          JavaScript on both the Front-End and Back-End, with more to come.
          <br />
          <br />
          Before coding, I was a professional gamer for around 3 and a half
          years, playing Apex Legends at international levels competing for
          prize money in tournaments. At my peak, I was ranked the number 1
          player worldwide for approximately 5 months concurrently, out of over
          100 million total unique players, and garnered over 80000 followers on
          'Twitch' as a result. It was during this time that I discovered
          software development through members of my community and started to
          take a big interest in Software & Web Development.
          <br /> <br />I am extremely motivated, and willing to do whatever it
          takes to make myself a better developer. I understand that I got holes
          in my knowledge due to my lack of time and experience, but I am not
          afraid to admit those holes and I do the very best I can to make sure
          they are filled as soon as possible. After completing the bootcamp, I
          realized that learning a CSS framework would serve me well to improve
          the aesthetic's of any future applications I make, so I chose to learn
          TailwindCSS. This is my first website built using it!
